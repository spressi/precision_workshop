:::notes
Simulated data with added noise. True score correlation *r* = 1

Side note: \
Individual errorbars = subject-level precision of each individual (across trials)\
Confidence band of regression slope = group-level precision of the regression estimate (cf. reporting CI around Pearson's r)
:::


## What is Precision? 2

1. Precision is indicated by errorbars / confidence intervals

2. Whenever you `summarize` across a variable, you can calculate the \
**precision of the aggregation**

## Trial-Level Precision

![[Holmqvist et al. (2023, retracted)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01762-8)](images/precision_trial.png)

Only relevant for time series data (i.e., several "measurements" per trial)

Note: Aggregation is not trivial here because of auto-correlation

## What is Precision? 3

1. Precision is indicated by errorbars / confidence intervals

2. Whenever you `summarize` across a variable, you can calculate the \
**precision of the aggregation**

3. Precision exists on different levels: group, subject, trial (and more)

:::notes
"group" is a very superficial term since you can have nested groups:\
classes in schools in cities in districts in countries, etc.

## Related Concepts

![cf. [Nebe, Reutter, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85980); Fig. 1](images/precision_related_concepts.png)

:::notes
validity: latent ("theoretical") match between

example for accuracy: systematic bias (miscalibration) in eye tracking

since *criterion validity* uses a comparison of two manifest variables, this approach can be used to quantify accuracy (absolute agreement) and precision (consistency)
:::

## Precision vs. Accuracy

## What is Reliability?

Not this!

![<http://highered.blogspot.com/2012/06/bad-reliability-part-two.html>](images/not_reliability.png)

## Where is Reliability highest?

![cf. [Nebe, Reutter, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85980); Fig. 2](images/precision_reliability.jpg)

## What is Reliability? 2

:::columns
:::column
\
(Intraclass) Correlation\
&rarr; explained variance:\
$R^2 = between / (between + within)$

\
Reliability tells you if (to what extent) you can **distinguish between low and high trait individuals**.

\
&rArr; Reliability = \
low subject-level variability (high precision) + \
*high* group-level variability (*low* precision!)

:::

:::aside
Note: Lack of precision does not automatically mean error variance! It can also be due to true score changes.
:::

:::notes
Spread of bullet holes is precision, not reliability.

Reliability is a COMPOUND MEASURE of high subject-level precision (i.e., low of within-subject variability) plus high between-subject variability (i.e., low group-level precision)\
&rArr; signal-to-noise ratio with \
between = signal & within = noise
:::

## Reliability Paradox

- Paradigms that produce robust results often show low reliability ([Hedge et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0935-1))

- Why do statistical significance and reliability *not* go hand in hand?


## Reliability Paradox

- Paradigms that produce robust results often show low reliability ([Hedge et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0935-1))

- Why do statistical significance and reliability *not* go hand in hand?

    * Statistical power is enhanced by high group-level precision, \
    reliability by high group-level *variability* (cf. previous slide)
    
    * More subjects only increase group-level precision (high power), leaving subject-level precision constant\
    **&rarr; sample size has no effect on the magnitude of reliability**

## Reliability vs. Group-Level Precision

- Group-level precision &hArr; homogenous sample

- Reliability &hArr; heterogenous sample

. . .

\
&rarr; Choosing your paradigm and sample, you can optimize for group-level significance OR reliability

. . .

\
Basic research favors different things than (clinical) application (or individual differences research)\
&rArr; Most of the time **group-level precision gets optimized at the cost of reliability**

:::notes
Of course, optimizing group-level significance by using homogenous samples is not good scientific practice
:::

## Trial-Level Precision to the Rescue!

Improving trial-level precision of the measurement benefits both subject- and group-level precision\

## Summary: What is Precision?

1. Precision is indicated by errorbars / confidence intervals

2. Whenever you `summarize` across a variable, you can calculate the \
**precision of the aggregation**

3. Precision exists on different levels: group, subject, trial (and more)

4. Closely linked to statistical power and reliability

## How Can We Enhance Precision?

1. Shield the measurement from random noise &rarr; precise equipment / paradigm\
&rArr; trial-level precision

2. Identify the **aggregation level of interest**:
    i) sample differences &rarr; optimize group-level precision: \
    many subjects that respond homogenously
    ii) correlational hypotheses / application &rarr; optimize subject-level precision: \
    systematic differences between individuals but little variability within subjects across many trials (mind "sequence effects"; cf. [Nebe, Reutter, et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85980))

&rArr; “two disciplines of scientific psychology” ([Cronbach, 1957](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0043943))

## Group- vs. Subject-Level Precision

:::columns
:::column
**Group-level Precision**

- Group differences (t-tests, ANOVA)

- Many subjects (independent observations)

- Homogenous sample (e.g., psychology students?)

:::
:::column
**Subject-level Precision**

- Correlations (e.g., Reliability)

- Many trials (careful: sequence effects!)

- Heterogenous/diverse sample

- Low variability within subjects across trials (i.e., SD~within~)
:::
:::

## Take Home Message

- We are in a replication crisis

- Increasing the number of subjects is not the only way to get out

- Sample size benefits basic research on groups only 

&rArr; Increase precision on the aggregate level of interest!

## The Standard Error (SE)

Calculates the (lack of) precision of a mean based on the \
standard deviation ($SD$) of the individual observations and their number ($n$)

$$SE = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$$

## The Standard Error (SE) in `R`

No base `R` function available &#128169;

1. Use `confintr::se_mean` (not part of the tidyverse)

2. Use a custom function

```{r}
#| echo: true

se <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE) {
  sd(x, na.rm) / sqrt(if(!na.rm) length(x) else sum(!is.na(x)))
}
```

:::aside
Careful with custom functions! I often see people using `n()` but this does not work correctly with missing values (`NA` / `na.rm = TRUE`)
:::

## The Standard Error (SE) in `R` 2

Whenever you use `mean`, also calculate the SE:

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)

iris %>% #helpful data set for illustration
  summarize( #aggregation => precision
    across(.cols = starts_with("Sepal"), #everything(), #output too wide
           .fns = list(mean = mean, se = confintr::se_mean)),
    .by = Species)
```

\
&rarr; subject-level (species-level) precision

## Standard Error Pitfalls in `R`

What is the group-level precision of `Sepal.Length`?

Note: Treat `Species` as subjects and rows within `Species` as trials.

```{r}
#| echo: true
data <-
  iris %>% 
  rename(subject = Species, measure = Sepal.Length) %>% 
  mutate(trial = 1:n(), .by = subject) %>% 
  select(subject, trial, measure) %>% arrange(trial, subject) %>% tibble()
print(data)
```

## Standard Error Pitfalls in `R`

What is the group-level precision of `Sepal.Length`?

```{r}
#| echo: true
data %>% 
  summarize(m = mean(measure),
            se = confintr::se_mean(measure))
```

. . .

\
```{r}
#| echo: true
data %>% 
  summarize(m = mean(measure),
            se = confintr::se_mean(measure),
            n = n())
```

## Standard Error Pitfalls in `R` 2

What is the group-level precision of `Sepal.Length`?

```{r}
#| echo: true
data %>% 
  summarize(measure.subject = mean(measure), .by = subject) %>% #subject-level averages
  summarize(m = mean(measure.subject),
            se = confintr::se_mean(measure.subject),
            n = n())
```

. . .

&rArr; When using trial-level data to calculate group-level precision, **summarize twice!**

&rArr; Every summarize brings you up exactly *one* level - don't try to skip!\
trial-level &rarr; subject-level &rarr; group-level

:::aside
Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) implicitly take this into account when specifying *random intercepts for subjects* `(1|subject)`.
:::

## Summary: Precision in `R`

```{r}
#| echo: true
data %>% 
  summarize(.by = subject, #trial- to subject-level
            measure.subject = mean(measure), #subject-level averages
            se.subject = confintr::se_mean(measure)) %>%  #subject-level precision
  summarize(m = mean(measure.subject), #group-level mean ("grand average")
            se = confintr::se_mean(measure.subject), #group-level precision
            se.subject = mean(se.subject), #average subject-level precision (note: pooling should be used)
            n = n())
```
