In the previous part, you learned about CIs around *means* and *effect sizes*.

CIs around means are for Figures.\
CIs around effect sizes are for the statistical reporting section.

## Visualizing CIs around means

In this part, we will visualize CIs around means for:

- t-tests (one sample, independent samples, & paired samples), 

- ANOVAs (a simple 2x2 interaction),

- and correlations.

You have already learned how to calculate CIs around their effect sizes (Cohen's *d*, $\eta_p^2$, and Pearson's *r*)

. . .

\
For all examples, we will use the `fhch2010` data set of the `afex` package that we have encountered before. Make sure that you have the subject-level aggregates ready:

```{r}
#| echo: true
fhch2010_summary <- 
  afex::fhch2010 %>% 
  summarise(rt = mean(rt), .by = c(id, task, stimulus))
```

## GgThemes

The default options in `ggplot` have some problems: Most importantly, text is too small. The easiest solution is to create your own theme that you apply to your plots.

I am currently using this theme adapted from an old script of [Lara Rösler](https://lararoesler.nl/).

```{r}
theme_set( # theme_set has to be executed every session; cf. library(tidyverse)
  myGgTheme <- # you can save your theme in a local variable instead, add it to every plot, and save your environment across sessions
    theme_bw() + # start with the black-and-white theme
    theme( 
      #aspect.ratio = 1,
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
      legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "grey"),
      legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white"),
      strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
      axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "black"),
      axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black"),
      axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black"),
      axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 16, color = "black"),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 16, color = "black"),
      axis.title = element_text(size = 16, color = "black"),
      legend.text = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"),
      legend.title = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"),
      strip.text = element_text(size = 12, color = "black"))
)
```

## One Sample t-test

Are the mean reaction times **for naming words** faster than 1 sec?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
fhch2010_summary_wordnaming <- 
  fhch2010_summary %>% 
  filter(task == "naming", stimulus == "word")

fhch2010_summary_wordnaming %>% 
  pull(rt) %>% 
  t.test(mu = 1, alternative = "less") %>% 
  apa::t_apa(es_ci = TRUE) # output to APA format
```

## One Sample t-test: Visualization Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2-6|4|8|5-6|10"
ostt <-
  fhch2010_summary_wordnaming %>% 
  summarize(
    rt.m = mean(rt), #careful! if you do rt = mean(rt), you cannot calculate ci_mean(rt) afterwards
    rt.m.low = confintr::ci_mean(rt)$interval[[1]], #not tidyverse-friendly :/
    rt.m.high = confintr::ci_mean(rt)$interval[[2]]) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(y = rt.m, x = "naming words")) +
  geom_point() + #plot the mean
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m.low, ymax = rt.m.high)) + #plot the CI
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed") #plot the population mean to test against
```

::: notes
"Beautiful" alternative:
```{r}
fhch2010_summary_wordnaming %>% 
  pull(rt) %>% 
  confintr::ci_mean() %>% 
  lapply(function(x) {
    attr(x, "class") <- NULL; #delete class attribute which kills bind_cols()
    return(x)}) %>% #return altered object for pipe-friendliness
  bind_cols()
```
:::
## One Sample t-test: Figure

```{r}
#| echo: false
ostt
```

## One Sample t-test - using a t.test()

Possible to use `t.test()` instead of `confintr::ci_mean()`!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "5-6"
ostt2 <- 
  fhch2010_summary_wordnaming %>% 
  summarize(
    rt.m = mean(rt),
    rt.m.low = t.test(rt)$conf.int[1], # also not tidy
    rt.m.high = t.test(rt)$conf.int[2]) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(y = rt.m, x = "naming words")) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m.low, ymax = rt.m.high)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed")
```

## Independent Samples t-test

Are the mean reaction times for **naming words** different from **lexically identifying words**?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| results: hold
fhch2010_summary_words <- 
  fhch2010_summary %>% 
  filter(stimulus == "word")

with(fhch2010_summary_words,
     t.test(rt ~ task) #Welch test
     #t.test(rt ~ task, var.equal = TRUE) #assume equal variances
) #%>% apa::t_apa(es_ci = TRUE) #does not work for Welch test :(
```

:::notes
You can also `pivot_wider` instead of using the formula notation:

```{r}
with(fhch2010_summary_words %>% 
       pivot_wider(names_from = task, values_from = rt), #ignore the NAs
     t.test(naming, lexdec) #Welch test
     #t.test(rt ~ task, var.equal = TRUE) #assume equal variances
) #%>% apa::t_apa(es_ci = TRUE) #does not work for Welch test :(
```
:::

## Independent Samples t-test: Viz Code?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2,4,9"
istt <-
  fhch2010_summary_words %>% 
  summarize(
    .by = task, #for more complex summaries, I like to put the .by argument first
    rt.m = mean(rt), #careful! if you do rt = mean(rt), you cannot calculate ci_mean(rt) afterwards
    rt.m.low = confintr::ci_mean(rt)$interval[[1]], #not tidyverse-friendly :/
    rt.m.high = confintr::ci_mean(rt)$interval[[2]]) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(y = rt.m, x = task)) +
  geom_point() + #plot the means
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m.low, ymax = rt.m.high)) #plot the CIs
```

## Independent Samples t-test: Figure?

```{r}
#| echo: false
istt
```

## CIs: comparing groups

Remember: `confintr::ci_mean` is for obtaining CIs to **test a single mean against a fixed (errorless) number** (most often `0`).

. . .

&rArr; Use `confintr::ci_mean_diff` to get the CI that accounts for the uncertainty in both means.

## Independent Samples t-test: CI of the difference

```{r}
with(fhch2010_summary_words %>% 
       pivot_wider(names_from = task, values_from = rt),
     confintr::ci_mean_diff(naming, lexdec))
```

## Independent Samples t-test: CI of the difference: Viz Code

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3|5|6-7|9"
istt2 <-
  fhch2010_summary_words %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = task, values_from = rt) %>% 
  summarize(
    rt.m = mean(naming, na.rm = TRUE) - mean(lexdec, na.rm = TRUE), #difference of the means == mean difference
    rt.m.low = confintr::ci_mean_diff(naming, lexdec)$interval[[1]], #not tidyverse-friendly :/
    rt.m.high = confintr::ci_mean_diff(naming, lexdec)$interval[[2]]) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(y = rt.m, x = "difference")) +
  geom_point() + #plot the mean difference
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m.low, ymax = rt.m.high)) + #plot the difference CI
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") #plot the population mean to test against
```
## Independent Samples t-test: CI of the difference: Figure

```{r}
#| echo: false
istt2

<!-- TODO: Option to plot this CI on both individual mean RTs (cf. ANOVA Viz Code 2) instead of plotting the mean difference -->

## Independent Samples t-test: using t.test()

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "6-7"
istt3 <-
  fhch2010_summary_words %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = task, values_from = rt) %>%

## Paired Samples t-test

Are the mean reaction times for **naming words** different from **naming non-words**?

There is a difference between the precision of the means (aggregated **across subjects**) and the \
precision of the paired differences (paired **within the same subjects** and then aggregated across).

## Between- vs. Within-Subject Error

Remember this plot? Between- and within-subject variance can be (partially) independent.

![cf. [Nebe, Reutter, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85980); Fig. 2](images/precision_reliability.jpg)

## Detour: Dependency of Between- & Within-Subject Errors

Between-subject variance does not affect within-subject variance but \
within-subject variance increases the estimate of between-subject variance ([Baker et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000337), Fig. 1)

![](images/Baker2021Fig1.png)

## Kinds of Error Variance in paired samples

:::notes
Use `Notes Canvas` (paint brush icon on bottom left) to draw worst possibility of paired differences in "Raw Data" and resulting increase in within-subjects error variance while between-subjects variance remains fixed.

## Within-Errors on Marginal Means

There are methods to draw within-subject errors directly on marginal means instead of on paired differences (e.g., [Morey, 2008](https://doi.org/10.20982/tqmp.01.1.p042)).

While this is okay for the simplest design including **one within-variable with just two factor levels**, this already becomes problematic at 3 levels because sphericity may not hold, i.e., the variance may be heterogenous across paired differences (level 1-2 vs. 2-3).

&rarr; If the CI for 1-2 is small but CI for 2-3 is large. What do you plot on factor level 2?

. . .

&rArr; The within-subjects standard error is a characteristic of paired differences and should thus not be plotted on factor levels.

## Correlations

What is the correlation between reactions to words and non-words in the lexical decision task?

. . .

We want to include subject-level CIs, so we need to start with the trial-level data!

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2,6-7"
fhch2010_summary2 <- 
  afex::fhch2010 %>% #trial-level data!
  filter(task == "lexdec") %>% 
  summarize(.by = c(id, task, stimulus), #retain task column for future reference
            rt.m = mean(rt),
            rt.m.low = confintr::ci_mean(rt)$interval[[1]], #subject-level CIs!
            rt.m.high = confintr::ci_mean(rt)$interval[[2]]) #subject-level CIs!

correl <- 
  with(fhch2010_summary2 %>% 
         pivot_wider(names_from = stimulus, values_from = rt.m, id_cols = id),
       cor.test(word, nonword)) %>% apa::cor_apa(r_ci = TRUE, print = FALSE)

# Visualizing "Raw Data"

As we see from the previous scatter plot, it is informative to see individual "raw data" points. Wouldn't this be nice to have for the group-differences plots (t-tests + ANOVA), too?

With `ggplot`, we can simply add a new layer on our previous plots `aov1` and `aov2`.

\
Quick technical note: Usually, we do not visualize the "raw" (trial-level) data but the subject-level *aggregates* (&rarr; we could always visualize subject-level precision!). \
<!--
But, hey! It's at least one additional level of information! &#128517;
-->

:::notes
We will not include subject-level precision in the next plots because it is irrelevant for group-level significance (except for its contribution to increasing group-level variance, which is already depicted in the group-level errorbars). Thus, the additional informational value is usually extremely limited while strongly decreasing readability of the plots (a lot of busy errorbars!).

Now that we have added individual points, can we also add individual slopes to show the variability in within-subject changes between words and nonwords?

::: notes
Go back to previous slide and ask where these lines would have to be added.

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| output-location: slide
aov3 <-
  fhch2010_summary %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = stimulus, values_from = rt, id_cols = c(id, task)) %>% 
  summarize(
    .by = task, # stimulus is implicitly kept due to pivot_wider
    ci.length = confintr::ci_mean(word - nonword)$interval %>% diff(), # do this first so we can overwrite word & nonword
    # ci.length = t.test(word, nonword, paired = TRUE)$conf.int[1:2] %>% diff(), # alternative - same result!
    word = mean(word, na.rm = TRUE), 
    nonword = mean(nonword, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(word, nonword), names_to = "stimulus", values_to = "rt.m") %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(y = rt.m, x = stimulus, color = task)) + # task and stimulus switched compared to aov2
  facet_wrap(vars(task), labeller = label_both) + # task and stimulus switched compared to aov2
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(.9)) + # explicitly specify default width = .9
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m - ci.length/2, ymax = rt.m + ci.length/2), 
                position = position_dodge(.9)) + # explicitly specify default width = .9
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.6, 1.4)) + # explicitly set axis to make plots comparable
  myGgTheme +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
aov3
```

## Stacked Points 3

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1,4-5|10-13|14-18"
#| output-location: slide
aov3 +
  geom_dotplot( # experts can try ggbeeswarm::geom_beeswarm()
    data = fhch2010_summary %>% rename(rt.m = rt), #conform to naming in aov3
    #aes(y = rt.m, x = stimulus), #inherited from aov3
    aes(fill = task), #dotplot dots have color = outer border, fill = inner color
    binaxis = "y",
    stackdir = "center",
    alpha = .5
  ) +
  geom_line( #add individual slopes
    data = fhch2010_summary %>% rename(rt.m = rt), #conform to naming in aov3
    aes(group = id), #one line for each subject; sometimes you need: group = interaction(id, task)
    alpha = .5) +
  #plot group-level information again (on top) but black and bigger
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(.9), color = "black", size = 3) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m - ci.length/2, ymax = rt.m + ci.length/2), 
                position = position_dodge(.9), 
                color = "black", linewidth = 1.125)
```

::: notes
Beautiful! So much information!

The slopes for naming are more pronounced and homogenous compared to lexdec.

But be careful! Between subjects errorbars! Can only compare across facets (tasks) but not within (words vs. non-words of the same task)\
&rArr; This is why some authors suggest to have another plot showing the paired differences only (i.e., `aov1` alongside `aov3`).

## Jittered Points

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2-6"
#| output-location: slide
aov3 +
  geom_jitter( # geom_jitter doesn't dodge the groups; geom_point with position_jitterdodge would lead to same result
    data = fhch2010_summary %>% rename(rt.m = rt), #conform to naming in aov3
    position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = .5),
    alpha = .5
  )
```

## Jittered Points with Individual Slopes

Only `geom_path()` is able to align points + lines! `geom_line()` will not work here. (Ordering can be important: `geom_path()` connects the observations in the order in which they appear in the data.)

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2-5|6-10|4,9"
#| output-location: slide
aov3 +
  geom_jitter(
    data = fhch2010_summary %>% rename(rt.m = rt),
    position = position_jitter(width = .25, seed = 1337), #same seed needed!
  ) +
  geom_path( #add individual slopes
    data = fhch2010_summary %>% rename(rt.m = rt), 
    aes(group = id),
    position = position_jitter(width = .25, seed = 1337), #same seed needed!
    alpha = .5) +
  #plot group-level information again (on top) but black and bigger
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(.9), color = "black", size = 3) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m - ci.length/2, ymax = rt.m + ci.length/2), position = position_dodge(.9), 
                color = "black", linewidth = 1.125)
```

## Density
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
#| output-location: slide
aov3 +
  geom_violin( 
    data = fhch2010_summary %>% rename(rt.m = rt), #conform to naming in aov3
    #aes(y = rt.m, x = stimulus), #inherited from aov3
    aes(fill = task), #dotplot dots have color = outer border, fill = inner color
    alpha = .5
  ) +
  geom_line( #add individual slopes
    data = fhch2010_summary %>% rename(rt.m = rt), #conform to naming in aov3
    aes(group = id), #one line for each subject; sometimes you need: group = interaction(id, task)
    alpha = .5) +
  #plot group-level information again (on top) but black and bigger
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(.9), color = "black", size = 3) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = rt.m - ci.length/2, ymax = rt.m + ci.length/2), position = position_dodge(.9), 
                color = "black", linewidth = 1.125)
```

## Tough Decisions
What looks most insightful (or most pleasing) depends heavily on your sample size (and your personal preference).

Usually, the plots shown here work best with sample size in ascending order:

1. `dot plot` for small samples

2. `jittered points` for medium samples

3. `violin plot` for large samples

## Everything Everywhere All at Once

If you are prone to decision paralysis, try a mixture of jittered points and violin plot: \
